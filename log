INFO:Xst:3031 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM <Mram_opcode[5]_GND_33_o_wide_mux_33_OUT> will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.

  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   882 out of   6,822   12%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,285
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,254 out of   3,285   38%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 203 out of   3,285    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,828 out of   3,285   55%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  54,576    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
